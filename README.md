## Clean Architecture

Clean Architecture is a software design philosophy that can help you build more modular, maintainable, and testable Flutter apps. It does this by separating the code into layers, with each layer having a specific responsibility. It is especially beneficial for large and complex apps.

Clean Architecture consists of three main layers: Data Layer, Domain Layer and Presentation Layer. Each layer has distinct responsibilities and limited dependencies.

## Advantages
- **Modularity and Independence:** Divide your application into independent parts, manage, and develop each separately.
- **Easy Testability:** Test the business logic independently, making it easier to detect errors.
- **Future Expandability:** Adding new features or modifying existing ones requires less effort.
- **Reusability:** Reuse the business logic in different projects or platforms.
- **Good Documentation:** Clearly defines the structure and operation for better project understanding and maintenance.
